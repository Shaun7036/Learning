# Introduction to Python

This document outlines the curriculum and details surrounding the _Introduction to Python Programming_ course given at the Students' Society of McGill University (2016-present) and available freely online at []().

## Course goals

The _Introduction to Python Programming_ course aims to give a good first exposition to programming using Python and assumes no prior knowledge of programming or computer science. As students work their way through the material, they should become increasingly at ease with using Python to solve problems and designing small systems. Another goal of the course is also to give tools to students to continue their learning independently once they reach the end of the offered material.

## Methods

This course is a mix of written material/lectures, assignments and projects. The theory segment provides the basis of practice problems and practical projects that can then be put together to solidify the understanding of the material.

Each topic document has numerous smaller review exercises embedded in it and includes bigger "assignments" which are meant to be harder problems that require a bit more insight into the features being studied. The projects are an extension of the assignments and are "kits" to build small but meaningful pieces of software.

## Topics

1. Setting up Python and its environment
2. Variables, functions and scripts
3. Control structures
