# In this section

In this section, we get started with Python. We set up our environment and define the scope of what we can do with Python.

Look at [GettingStarted.md](https://github.com/mcataford/Learning/blob/master/IntroToPython/1.%20Getting%20Started/GettingStarted.md) for the long-form lecture material and [AdditionalTools-Git.md]() for more details on how to set up and use __Git__ on your computer.
